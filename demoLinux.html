mkdir hapy birthday <==> mkdir "hapy birthday"
mkdir -p parent/dir0 -> sẽ tạo ra, nếu mà k có -p thì k tạo ra dc (can be used to create entire folder paths)
mkdir -p delfolder/deleteme{1,2,3}
touch delfolder/deletee{1,2,3}/file{1,2,3} -> rm -ri delfolder/
cp file1.csv file2.csv dir1/ -> cp file?.csv dir1/ cp -a file?.csv dir1/
touch file{a,B,C}{A..C}.txt
ls -l file*(file1.csv file2.csv) 
ls -l dir1/file* (file1.csv file2.csv) 
rm -vi FILE*.txt // delete file rm *2*, rm *[2,3]*
rm -r, rmdir commands to delete folder    
the i option will allow the rm command to be interactive when deleting


cp: copy file, folder
cp file1.txt file2.txt destination/
rm file*
cp destination/* . (..)
the r option allows you to copy entire folders recursively
cp -r copy_me/ destination/

mv to move and rename files and folders
mv oldfolder/ newfolder
mv newfolder/* . -> mv file* newfolder/
mv newfolder/ ~/Documents/
mv ~/Documents/newfolder/ ./jackpot

locate command to search for files
locate *.conf -> ...
- The locate command seraches a db for files and returns a list of results.
- Using a db is very fast, but requires updating
- To help protect aganst errors you can use the --sxisting and --fllow options
- Best thing to do is just update the db (done automaticaally daily)
- This requires admin privileges and therefore the sudo command is used

find: find: tìm tại chính thư mục hiện tại, find /home
find . -maxdepth 2
find . -type d(directory) f(file)
find /etc -maxdepth 1 -type f
find . -name "3.txt" "*.txt"
find -iname "TXT"

cat alpha.txt <==> tac alpha.txt
cat file [1-5].txt | tac (tac > reversed.txt)
people

hello

cat file [1-5].txt | tac | rev
elpoep
lufituaeb
uoy
ereht
olleh

less

find | less

cat file [1-5].txt | head -n 2 (tail -n 2)
find | head -n 5 | tac

Read file
cat file[1-5].txt > beautiful.txt

sort file
sort words.txt > sorted.txt <==> sort -r words.txt | less
sort -n(nr) numbers.txt | less

rmdir command will only delete folders that are empty 
head -n 15 Trump.txt tail -n 1 Trump.txt

WILDCARD <==> REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
- *: mtaches anything, regardless of length
- ?: matches anything, butt just for one place
- []: matches just one place, but allows you to specify options.
ls *.txt, file[123].txt <==> file[1-3].txt, file?.txt, FILE[0-9ABC] file[0-9][A-Z][a-z].txt
ls f*
ls [Ff]* <==> ls [!Ff]*
ls FILE??.txt
ls [[:alpha:]]* ls [![:alpha:]]*
ls [[:digit:]]* ls [![:digit:]]* lower, upper
ls FILE[s1]*.txt (s hoặc 1 rồi ở sau)
ls -l /etc | head -n 20

Sort tabular data using the -k option
3nr : sort using column 3, and use the -n and -r option
ls -lh /etc | head -n 20 | sort -k 5hr

(wc -l manuscript.txt)

Searching File content using grep command
grep -i a manuscript.txt
grep -ic a ("our boys") manuscript.txt 
man -k print | grep files

Archiving and compression (XEM TIEEP, gzip, bzip)
tar -cvf ourarchive.tar
tar -xvf ourarchive.tar


ls Documents Dowloads Pictures Desktop <==> ls *
ls D* => Desktop Documents Downloads

BASH SCRIPT
- Allow you to store usefull command sequences in files
- must have #!/bin/bash as the first line
- Scripts are more powerfuul than alases and can be sacheduled
#!/bin/bash

mkdir ~/Desktop/magic
cd ~/Desktop/magic
touch file{1..100}
ls -lh ~/Desktop/magic > ~/Desktop/magic.log  -> bash out.sh


CRON...

/bin - Binaries: contains programs that are essential for the system to boot and run
 - executable, binary, essential 
/boot - Boot Files: constains the Linux kernel, initial RAM disk image for drives need at boot time
 - Linux kernel, initial RAM disk image, boot loader(GRUB)  /boot/grub contains grub configuration files, /boot/vmlinuz contains the Linux kernel
/dev - device Nodes
 - all devices represented here as files, /dev/sda1 (sda - name of a disk) USB devices, cpu etc


HARD vs SYMBOLIC Links(về phía hệ điều hành các file được phân biệt định danh bằng chỉ số inode.)
- ln file_name hard_link_name

- ln -s file_name soft_link_name
- ln -s folder_name soft_link_name

ln file1 hardLink
ln -s file2 softLink
ls -l -> file1 file2 hardLink softLink -> file2

<!-- 
DIFFERENCE between the commands, terminal, shell
- Commands are just text you type in the terminal.
- Commands are interpreted by the shell.
- Different shells can interpret the same text in different ways.
- The terminal is the window to the shell.
- Commands are case-sensitive


which echo -> /bin/echo, which cal -> /usr/bin/cal

command = Command Name -options(-option 1 -option 2) inputs(input 1 input 2)
 - CmmmandName needs to be on the shell's search path.
 - Commands operate on inputs.
 - Options modify a command's behaviour

Command Input + Output
- Learn about the different ways a command can take input and give output.
- You will understand the ways data flows into and out of command.
- Be ready to connect commands together to build powerful pipelines

LINUX FILE SYSTEM
- Follows a tree-like structure
- Everything can be traced bac to the / directory
- The root user has absolute power of the system
- /home stores home directories for all regular users on the system


Absolute paths start at the base (/) directory
Relative paths start from the current directory
